Listeners can call in and bid on cool prize packages hand picked and put together by our very own KCPR DJ's.  It's the biggest fundraiser we put on and it's basically how we keep our independent, musically-minded, community and volunteer-driven station up and running. The proceeds help us keep the lights on, replace aging equipment and keep cool tunes on air for listeners like you.               </p>
