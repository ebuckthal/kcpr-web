</table><p><B>Q: My band is from L.A. / San Diego / not the Central Coast etc. Can we play on the show?</B><BR>
  <STRONG><FONT color=ff3300>A: No</FONT></STRONG>. Sorry, but this is a locals' only program. KCPR is open to out of town bands, but you would need to contact our Program Director. If you live and play locally - within a 50-60 mile radius of San Luis Obispo - you're eligible to play on Sessions.</p>
<P><B>Q: Do we have to bring our own PA to the studio?</B><BR><FONT color=ff3300><STRONG>A:No. </STRONG></FONT>KCPR has a professional 16 channel mixer, a wide array of microphones and all cables necessary, effects and processors, monitoring equipment, and volunteer engineers. All you need to bring is yourself, your instruments and your amplifiers, your instrument cables, etc. If you need specialty equipment, you may need to arrange it with the engineers in advance. Most cases you won't need it or we can get it for you. Please bring an amp if you plan on plugging in your acoustic guitar or a keyboard.  Monitoring is done like a stage show by use of floor monitors (no headphones)</P>
<P><B>Q: Sound check is an hour before airtime, so show up then?</B><BR><FONT color=ff3300><STRONG>A:No. </STRONG></FONT>Please be ready to play a whole hour before the program is set to air. Because of the amount of time involved with setting up microphones, level checking, and mixing, any bands that are not ready for sound check may not be ready by air time. Please do not attempt to secure a timeslot unless you are sure that both the performers and the equipment can be at the studio and ready to play by soundcheck.</P>
<P><B>Q: What is the time line for the day of the show?</B><br>4:00-4:30 Band arrives and loads in<br>4:30-5:00 Band completes setting up instruments<br>5:00-5:15 Engineers set up microphones and other equipment<br>5:15-5:45 Band and engineers run sound check<br>5:45-6:00 Host and engineers prep for airtime<br>6:00-7:00 Airtime<br>7:00-7:30 Band load out and clean up<br><b>Band out of bullding by 8:00pm</b></p>
<P><B>Q: Our drummer / guitarist / etc. can't be at the station until airtime. Is that OK?</B><BR><FONT color=ff3300><STRONG>A: No.</STRONG> </FONT>We require that all band members and equipment be present and accounted for by sound check time. Sound check is one hour prior to air time. If a member cannot be available, we advise not booking a date.</P>
<P><B>Q: Can we park our vehicles anywhere and will KCPR buy our permit and pay for any tickets we receive during the show?</B><BR><FONT color=ff3300><STRONG>A: No.</STRONG></FONT> KCPR is not liable for any fees or penalties you may incur as a result of appearing on the program. Please follow the campus parking rules to the letter. We may be able to arrange a loading spot (ONLY for loading) but this must be arranged AT LEAST one day in advance. KCPR has no special deals to keep you from harm. Even our exec staff gets ticketed from time to time for not following the rules - hell, the host even got his car impounded. Heed the rules is our best advice. <FONT color=009933><STRONG>Parking is free on weekends in both metered and staff spots.</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><B>Q: Is there any way to get a recorded copy of the show?</B><BR><FONT color=009933><STRONG>A: Yes. </STRONG></FONT>We record all shows to HD for our archive and then make you a CD. Turn around time is usually one week to a month. Currently, some shows are taking longer than anticipated due to editing and equipment issues.  KCPR reserves the right to use tracks from your appearance on compilation CDs but you also have the right to reproduce your own performance for your own use or sale.</P>
<P><B>Q: Can we bring friends to watch us in the studio?</B><BR><FONT color=009933><STRONG>A:Yes. </STRONG></FONT>Guests are welcome. Please keep in mind that we have a small studio, and they will all probably have to peer through a doorway. You are also responsible that they be on their best behavior.</P>
<P><B>Q: Can we talk about our upcoming gigs and releases?</B><BR><FONT color=009933><STRONG>A: Yes.</STRONG> </FONT>We expect you to. If you want to be interviewed, you'll have to arrange topics ahead of time so the host can be prepared. Better yet, you can have one of your friends or band mates interview you as well.</P>
<P><B>Q: Can we swear like sailors?</B><BR><FONT color=ff3300><STRONG>A: Probably not. </STRONG></FONT>Although we are not a big time corporate radio entity, we still have to follow FCC rules. As such, there are certain words, phrases or topics for which we could be fined and should not be aired on our station. If, however, you feel the artistic integrity would be degraded by omitting the phrase, you can argue the case to keep it. In any case, err on the side of caution when putting together your set list. There is a difference between indecency and art according to the FCC and we must abide. Most problems arise not from the songs but from the banter between songs.</P>
<P><B>Q: I hear you are located on the second floor. Our equipment is heavy, is there an elevator?</B><BR><FONT color=009933><STRONG>A: Yes. </STRONG></FONT>There is an elevator accessible from the southwest entrance to the first floor. You may want to bring a dolly as well.</P></td>
