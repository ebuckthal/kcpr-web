RELEASE NOTES - rss2php

  rss2php v0.2
----------------

Released 17/11/04

rss2php is a library of php scripts that will parse RSS feeds, and give an
output for php pages.

You can use the library to parse multiple RSS feeds and display them on one web
page, exactly how you want it to be displayed. rss2php is just a library of
scripts for you to use - it will not output a nice graphical interface for you,
it is mainly to be used so that your own pages can access RSS feeds.

If you want a very nice home page with images, column layout and more, for
multiple feeds, then you will have to download rss-homepage which will be based
on this code.

Getting Started:
- Extract the archive to a folder that can be served to clients on your web
  server.
- Open up example.php (wherever it is) in your web browser. This will show you
  a very basic example of what is possible.
- Read example.php and use it to create your own pages to parse RSS feeds.
- Modify update.sh to save the feeds you want to the directory where you
  extracted the archive.
- You will probably want to add update.sh to a cron job so that it downloads the
  feeds every so often.

At the moment rss2php contains:

	* rss.php - the main RSS parsing script
    
	* defaultconfig.php - a default config file with instructions on how to
		create your own
        
	* slashdot.php - an example config file for parsing the Slashdot RSS feed
    
	* example.php - a sample page that contains the output for Slashdot and BBC
		news feeds using the slashdot and default config files
        
	* update.sh - a very simple script to download and cache the RSS feeds
		needed (this will probably need to be modified by you - it downloads
		cached feeds to ~/public_html/rss so you might want to change this)
        
	* bbccache.xml and slashdotcache.xml - cached feeds from the BBC and
		Slashdot
