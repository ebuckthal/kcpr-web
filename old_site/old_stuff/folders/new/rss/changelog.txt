CHANGELOG - rss2php

  Version 0.2
---------------
Released 17/11/04

- This release is mainly bug fixes, but I bumped it up to version 0.2 as this
  is what rss-homepage (a complete suite to output an aesthetic home page very
  easily with multiple feeds) will probably be based on.
- Cleaned up the file structure (all files are in one folder)
- Added acknowledgment of portions of the code in release notes
- Renamed the output page to example.php
- Added references to rss-homepage in example file
- Updated some config files (very minor fixes)


  Version 0.1
---------------
Released 15/11/04

- First release, containing rss.php - parser file, defaultconfig.php - a default
  config file, slashdot.php - slashdot config, Slashdot and BBC caches,
  index.php - an example output page, and update.sh - a simple update script.
