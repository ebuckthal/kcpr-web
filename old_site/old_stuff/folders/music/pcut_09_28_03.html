              Each week the Stacks Manager adds 4-6 albums we call P-cuts. Their 
              aim is to dig up those forgotten gems that have been lost in obscurity, 
              and to spotlight the innovative and influential works that have 
              inspired the artists we enjoy now. If you would like to suggest 
              an album/artist/or theme, please write to the Stacks Manager. </p>
            <p><b>Week of 9/28-10/4 - </b>&quot;We Put the ROCK in Cleveland Rocks&quot;</p>
            <p> <b>Dead Boys - Young Loud and Snotty</b> (1977, Sire)<br>
              If the grit and gristle, sonic bombast, and snarling vocals of the 
              first track are any indication, the Dead Boys inherited Rocket from 
              the Tomb's volatile punk side - and ugly birth marks. Look at it 
              this way: four out of the five schlocks you see on the cover died 
              of some kind of drug overdose. Life styles put aside, this is a 
              messy, meaty, perverse slab of rock n roll. Cheetah Chrome's licks 
              will have you air guitaring for sure, and the legendary Stiv Bator's 
              growl is a visceral experience that will cause you to perform your 
              own cathartic acrobatics.</p>
            <p><b>Pere Ubu - The Modern Dance </b>(1978, Geffen)<br>
              Ahh, Dave Thomas. He sounds like Big Bird gone berserk, and yet, 
              he conjures up so much energy on the first release by Pere Ubu that 
              his high-pitched paranoid warble will convince any punk rock purist 
              to acknowledge the arty, cerebral, and abstract music of Pere Ubu 
              as a turbulent force to be reckoned with. Tom Herman's guitar work 
              hisses and shrieks before melting into its own feed back while the 
              rhythm section pounds out angular sound forms that pre-date anything 
              by Gang of Four or Wire. Highly experimental and cutting-edge for 
              its time, it still sounds absolutely fresh today.</p>
            <p><b>Rocket from the Tombs - The Day the Earth Met&#133;</b> (2002, 
              Smogveil)<br>
              Shall I compare thee to scorching plane wreckage? Huh? Let me explain: 
              This Cleveland collective of miscreants, Lou Reed romancers, and 
              Iggy Pop idolizers never got together to record a proper studio 
              album, so instead what have we got here: a collection of live material 
              - packaged primitive rhythmic noise that bangs and rattles the attention 
              span. Get cut up on the jagged, atonal guitar lines and watch these 
              songs go up in fuzz. And like any devastating experience, there 
              is an atmosphere of bleakness throughout the album, primarily provided 
              by Peter Laughner's mournful guitar. The static solo in &quot;30 
              Seconds over Tokyo&quot; is suitable black box material - one last 
              desperate cry out to the rest of the world. Bonus: Dig the Velvet 
              Underground cover of &quot;Foggy Notion&quot;.</p>
            <p><br>
              <b>V/A: Those Were Different Times</b> (1997, Scat)<br>
              This is a great compilation that highlights the underground Cleveland 
              scene circa 1972-1976. You get a whopping 26 tracks total for three 
              bands. The Mirrors pull off the psychedelic garage rock that all 
              the hipster kids are starting to claim nowadays. The Electric Eels 
              are beyond words. Turn up the volume knob on these guys and prepare 
              for a proper freak out. The Styrenes play a muscular rock beat that 
              although economic, relies on its primitive orangutan instincts for 
              survival.</p>
