              Each week the Stacks Manager adds 4-6 albums we call P-cuts. Their 
              aim is to dig up those forgotten gems that have been lost in obscurity, 
              and to spotlight the innovative and influential works that have 
              inspired the artists we enjoy now. If you would like to suggest 
              an album/artist/or theme, please write to the Stacks Manager. </p>
            <p><b>Week of 10/6 - 10/11: </b>&quot;YO! KCPR Raps&quot;</p>
            <p><b>Mantronix</b> - <i>The Album</i> (Warlock, 1985)<br>
              Curtis Khaleel, a.k.a. Mantronix, must have arrived to New York 
              city through some back-through-time teleport technology way beyond 
              our imaginations. With a rhyming style akin to that of Run-DMC or 
              LL Cool J, Khaleel's first album fared much better with the club 
              crowd than with the tight knit hip-hop circle due to its dancier, 
              electro-funk vibe. Released in '85, The Album sounds as futuristic 
              as he, what with all the synthesizers and robo-voice samples thrown 
              in. MC Tee's beats are thick, machine-like stomps that perfectly 
              accompany the Mantronix delivery: aggressive, adventurous, and always 
              on the beat. </p>
            <p> <b>Eric B. &amp; Rakim</b> - <i>Follow the Leader</i> (Uni, 1988)<br>
              Rakim drops his rhymes like a ninja throws a killer star, and on 
              Follow the Leader, the follow-up album to the landmark Paid in Full, 
              his razor tipped tongue is continuously clever, direct, and dangerously 
              deft. Trailblazing beatsmith Eric B. lays heavy funk samples over 
              raw, rocking beats, and on instrumental cuts like &quot;Eric B. 
              Never Scared&quot; he exercises his skills and defines the beat 
              that made the Golden Age of Hip-Hop so luminous.</p>
            <p><br>
              <b>Black Sheep</b> - <i>A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing</i> (Mercury, 
              1991)<br>
              Part of the Native Tongues crew, Black sheep share the similar laid-back 
              organic sound that set De La Soul and A Tribe Called Quest apart 
              from the rest of their hip-hop contemporaries. Dres and Mista Lawnge 
              may rap for the intelligent, socially conscious listener, but they 
              sure don't want you to think they're a bunch of stuffy jelly-doughnut-making 
              suckas. An album of tremendous energy, imagination, and content, 
              the duo laces their smooth jazz-beat rhymes with humor ranging from 
              biting social commentary to adolescent pleasing potty-humor. (listen 
              to - but don't play over the air! - track 2)</p>
            <p><br>
              <b>Pete Rock &amp; C.L. Smooth</b> - <i>Mecca and the Soul Brother</i> 
              (Elecktra, 1992)<br>
              With an excellent backdrop of horns, R&amp;B and soul samples, and 
              smooth organ lines, Pete Rock raps his reflective and intimate rhymes 
              with confidence, assertiveness, and graceful ability. The 80 plus 
              minutes of music cover a remarkable scope of ideas, emotions, and 
              hot MC production skills making Mecca and the Soul Brother one of 
              the strongest albums of early east coast hip-hop.</p>
