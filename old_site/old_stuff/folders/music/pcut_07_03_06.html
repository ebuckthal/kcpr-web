              Each week the Stacks Manager adds 4-6 albums we call P-cuts. Their 
              aim is to dig up those forgotten gems that have been lost in obscurity, 
              and to spotlight the innovative and influential works that have 
              inspired the artists we enjoy now. If you would like to suggest 
              an album/artist/or theme, please write to the Stacks Manager. </p>
            <p>P-Cuts for the week of 3 July 2006:        
            <p><strong>New Order</strong><br>
              Power, Corruption &amp; Lies was released March, 1983, a synthesizer-based<br>
              outing and a dramatic change in sound from Joy Division and the<br>
              preceding album. Starting from what earlier singles had hinted, this<br>
              was where the band had found their footing, mixing early techno music<br>
              in with their earlier guitar-based sound, heavily inspired by acts<br>
              like Kraftwerk and Giorgio Moroder. Also, the group had begun to adopt<br>
              abstract, seemingly nonsensical lyrics, with a curious naiveity to<br>
              them, effectively the polar opposite of Curtis' brooding poetry. Also,<br>
              as seen at the end of the emotive &quot;Your Silent Face&quot;, Sumner seems to<br>
              have adopted an ironic, satirical sense of humour, finishing the song<br>
              with the line &quot;why don't you piss off&quot;, a quality that the band has<br>
              taken to heart over the years.
            <p><strong>Belle and Sebastian</strong><br>
              If You're Feeling Sinister (1996) is the second album from Scottish<br>
              pop group Belle &amp; Sebastian, released by the independent label<br>
              Jeepster Records. The book in the background of the cover of the album<br>
              is The Trial by Franz Kafka. The album was released to much critical<br>
              praise in 1996, and was followed soon after by The Boy with the Arab<br>
              Strap, which overall garnered mixed reviews compared to its<br>
              predecessor. Sinister is widely considered to be an indie pop classic,<br>
              and has garnered a cult following among fans. The album is also<br>
              sometimes considered to be Belle &amp; Sebastian's career high point. Band<br>
              leader Stuart Murdoch has stated in interviews that this is probably<br>
              his best collection of songs, although they are not very well<br>
              recorded. In 2005, Belle &amp; Sebastian released a live version of the<br>
              album entitled If You're Feeling Sinister: Live at the Barbican on the<br>
              iTunes Music Store. Its purpose was to offer fans a better recorded<br>
            version of If You're Feeling Sinister</p>
            <p><strong>Hold Steady</strong><br>
              The Hold Steady are a Brooklyn-based musical group, although the<br>
              members have strong connections to the Minneapolis region of<br>
              Minnesota&mdash;something that is frequently reflected in the group's<br>
              lyrics. Frontman Craig Finn was previously vocalist for Twin Cities<br>
              band Lifter Puller. Their first album Almost Killed Me (2004) was a<br>
              sleeper hit among music critics, later appearing at #31 in the<br>
              influential Pazz &amp; Jop listing in New York's Village Voice. Some<br>
              months later in May 2005, they were the first rock group to grace the<br>
            Voice's front page in 15 years.</p>
