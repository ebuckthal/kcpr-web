            <p>Brightblack Morning Light (self titled), Matador 2006 </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing in this world sadder to me than overhearing somebody rag on the Grateful Dead. &nbsp; I'd be willing to bet that this intense hatred is probably only 30-40% based on the music itself; the other 2/3 of the reason being more of a subconscious revolt against &lsquo;60s idealism and the hippie stereotype. &nbsp; And I'll be the first to admit it &ndash; Deadheads are easy to hate. &nbsp; They dress in ridiculous ways, use acid-fried accentuation, and are known to smell up a room with only the slightest increase in temperature. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But people usually fail to realize that the reason the Grateful Dead are so wonderful has very little to do with the culture that surrounds them. &nbsp; It has much, much more to do with what can only be described as &ldquo;good vibes&rdquo;&mdash;a theory I admittedly stole from Geologist of Animal Collective. &nbsp; He and I both appreciate the Grateful Dead on an entirely intuitive level, devoid of ration. &nbsp; For me, the music is akin to some sort of aural Prozac; I enter some peaceful trance-like state the second I hear that joyous jam-bandery. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meet Brightblack Morning Light, described on their website as &ldquo;a gathering of N. Shineywater, Rabinyah, Elias Reitz, Benbob, Lolly Schlitz-Fah, Mariee Sioux and other friends and herbs!&rdquo; N. Shineywater, who by the way goes by Nabob (just say that aloud and you'll realize how crazy that is &ndash; NAY-BOB!), is the group's leader, and like much of the rest of the band hails from somewhere in Alabama. &nbsp; Members of the group met each other whilst homeless, they wear gigantic Blue-Blockers at night, and curate an annual festival in Big Sur called Quiet Quiet Ocean Spell. &nbsp; And the reason you should love Brightblack has absolutely nothing to do with all that &ndash; it's just &ldquo;good vibes&rdquo;. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To comply with the parlance of our times, &ldquo;good vibes&rdquo; will henceforth be referred to as &ldquo;aural Prozac,&rdquo; or aP. &nbsp; Now if your brain is wired a certain way, you will be completely helpless against Brightblack Morning Light's aP, which is much different than the Grateful Dead's aP. &nbsp; Let's say for instance, you happen to enjoy slowcore bands from the mid 90s like Low and early Mojave 3. &nbsp; Or, maybe you fall prey to the woozy, country-tinged charms of bands like Mazzy Star and the Cowboy Junkies. &nbsp; Hell, even if you dig any of the music coming out of the current psych-folk boom (ie: Six Organs of Admittance, Wooden Wand, Vetiver), you're bound to have the perfect chemical imbalance for this musical antidepressant. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brightblack are a jam-band for the shoegazer crowd, letting a vintage organ and two percussionists lead the music through hazy slide guitar melodies and harmoniously comatose sighs. &nbsp; And, although the music is occasionally propelled upwards with a drum break or increase in rhythmic speed, things remain remarkably relaxed the whole way through. &nbsp; The record feels comfortable enough in it's own skin to be truly beautiful, letting light and melody in at all the perfect times. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There's a lot to enjoy about this record, and I strongly recommend listeners to not allow the group's marketing schtick to obscure that. &nbsp; Yes, there are members named Nabob, Rabob and Benbob. &nbsp; But don't forget that San Luis Obispo's own Mariee Sioux is a member of the band as well, and they even just completed a tour together. &nbsp; Yes, Nabob looks JUST LIKE Mitch Hedberg, and talks with a warm country twang. &nbsp; But he's nonetheless authentic, and if he keeps making albums like this someday Nabob's gathering could produce an indie-rock Aoxomoxoa.</p>
