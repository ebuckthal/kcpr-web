            <p>Be Your Own Pet  (self titled), Universal 2006 </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a feeling the amount you will like this album is probably directly, if not exponentially, related to your interest in being a complete and total crazed asshole.&nbsp; Not being a square is definitely a huge plus.&nbsp; For those of us with rough edges, this album is the most amazing thing ever.&nbsp; The album hovers in between being completely and totally in your face and being COMPLETELY AND TOTALLY IN YOUR FUCKING FACE.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I managed to catch the band for the first time last summer on tour with Q and not U.&nbsp; It was a great summer of showing up at shows alone with a mere desire to dance manically even if all the other indie kids desired smoking and staring.&nbsp; With such a mind state, there can be no better band.&nbsp; They pounded on stage pushing the quarter of audience that were complete dicks straight into the other three quarters who were haunting the bar and back corners.&nbsp; Their lead singer hailed back every insult from the audience like the most disgusting of rockers.&nbsp; Add to the amazement of this, the fact that she is a blond high school hottie.&nbsp; Not a scenester hottie.&nbsp; Straight up just a cutie by anyone's standards.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Their new album packs all the wildness and straight-up immaturity of their live show which has built up quite the internet following and landed them a spot on this year's bill at Coachella.&nbsp; The lyrics never attempt to be deep.&nbsp; It's superficial, young, and just really fun.&nbsp; Come on, a song about bicycles!!!&nbsp; Songs about being &quot;an independent motherfucker&quot; and &quot;taking away your virginity.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;While most of the CD moves across at lightning quick pace with 1 to 2 minute blasts of&nbsp; insanity, the band slows it down.&nbsp; Well, a little.&nbsp; Like, some three-minute songs that don't require the movement of a cardiac arrest.&nbsp; It's definitely a good thing as anything else would seem out of place.&nbsp; But, hey a little bit of variation in the formula is good.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If anything, I was a little bit disappointed that some of the songs on their smaller EP's didn't make it on the album.&nbsp; The band has never been better than on their &quot;Damn Damn Leash&quot; EP which seemed to catch a little bit more of their craziness before it was given an exact direction by numerous articles.&nbsp; Songs like &quot;Spill&quot; simply were juvenile and dance crazy while some of the songs on this self-titled full-length feel like they have been created merely to fit the format of the band.&nbsp; But, hey it's not like the format requires a lot of emotional involvement anyway. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So, to all of you little kids out there Be Your Own Pet has a message: &quot;Have fun and be safe with it / Just kidding, FUCK SHIT UP!&quot;&nbsp; Tear down those boundaries, baby, and have a good summer.&nbsp; I probably lost anybody uptight halfway through anyway with all this pointless cursing.&nbsp; So, for those of you left&hellip;.let's go get wasted and punch car windows.</p>
