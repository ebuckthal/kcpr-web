              Each week the Stacks Manager adds 4-6 albums we call P-cuts. Their 
              aim is to dig up those forgotten gems that have been lost in obscurity, 
              and to spotlight the innovative and influential works that have 
              inspired the artists we enjoy now. If you would like to suggest 
              an album/artist/or theme, please write to the Stacks Manager. </p>
            <p><b>11/3 - 11/7</b>: &quot;Sticks and Stone May Break my Bones, 
              but this Funk will get me Nice and Nasty&quot;</p>
            <p><b>Fred Wesley and the Horny Horns</b> - <i>The Final Blow</i><br>
              This set of jazzy funk instrumentals is the perfect soundtrack to 
              a most groovy night of celebration. That fro will defiantly bounce 
              as the horns pierce through the driving rhythm section of popping 
              bass lines and drums, though the booty will have time to cool off 
              as things calm down over the smooth sax lines and silky guitar riffs 
              on the slower cuts.</p>
            <p><b>Betty Davis</b> - <i>They Say I'm Different</i><br>
              Betty Davis is a cheetah-walking freak that wants to pounce all 
              over you, and if there is anything that the once married to Miles 
              Davis diva is good at, it's conjuring up the arousing, hyper-sexual 
              side of the funk genre. That said, this is booty-to-the-grind funk 
              that will have every mama looking for her daddy: thick, thumping, 
              popping bass, sleazy organ lines, and the schizophrenic whisper-to-wail 
              that is Davis' voice.</p>
            <p><br>
              <b>Bootsy Collins</b> - <i>Ahh&#133;The Name is Bootsy Baby!</i><br>
              Come along all you funkateers, the man that gave P-Funk its bottom 
              gets off the mother ship connection to play some seriously in-funk-tious 
              (get of my case, this is how I get my kicks every week) slabs of 
              pounding, life-breathing tunes. The up-tempo tracks are completely 
              smoking, and the slower tunes are defiantly successful at complementing 
              the hand-cuffs and bottle of champagne. </p>
            <p><b>B.T. Express</b> - <i>The Best of B.T. Express</i><br>
              This compilation collects the best from the band, and simultaneously, 
              collects cuts that are prime examples of what made the '70's funk 
              scene so exciting. The grooves are laid on thick with an exciting 
              up-tempo rhythm section, the vocals sizzle, and the overall vibe 
              of these cuts resonates with a powerful sense of free-wheeling fun 
              and celebration.</p>
